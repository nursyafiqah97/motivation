	<p style="color: navy">3. Plan your schedule</p>
	Student need to plan their own learning schedule. Make sure you include all tasks deadlines, exams and other important dates in your schedule. Every weekend, students can spending time doing exercises, reading, memorizing and so on. Students also should be good at finding learning materials and not relying solely on lecturers.</p>

	<p style="color: purple">4. Take a Breaks</p>
	Taking strategic breaks can refresh your mind, restore motivation and increase productivity. Take a break to do some yoga, getting something to eat, enjoying a coffee or tea, a short power nap (10 to 20 minutes), or just get some fresh air. Movement is good for the body and can help boost your energy. A change of scenery and environment will also do wonders for your energy levels and reduce stress. You can then return to your studies refreshed and ready to focus.</p>

	<p style="color: navy">5. Create an Inspiring Study Space</p>
	Studying from home is a nice perk of online education. Creating a space where you can study and make you feel more motivated. Get some peace and quiet such as you need a quiet place to study without distractions from things like television, family, or roommates. Consider ergonomics with adjust the height of your chair, keyboard, and screen so that you are comfortable. Forearms and thighs should be level and parallel to the floor and wrists should not be bent while typing. Set up good lighting and comfortable seating then lighting in the room should be at least as bright as the computer screen to avoid eye strain. This helps you get into your task faster and avoid distractions to focus on your studies.</p>
